I've been meaning to move to CloudFlare for a while, and thanks to this [amazingly helpful page](https://httpsiseasy.com/) created by Troy Hunt, I've taken the leap.

I've been battling for time, and this really took all the research requirements right out of it, and I'm up and running with SSL even though my host doesn't support it on the cheap hosted package I'm using.
