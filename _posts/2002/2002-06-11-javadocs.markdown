```

which will result in all java files in my packagefolder being documented in the targetfolder.

All javadoc comments should be between a /** and a */. The following tags can be used:

 - **@author** - author of a class
- **@param** - parameter
- **@return** - what the method returns

- **@version** - version number
- **<code>....</code>** tags can be used to identify code-related text (e.g. when referring to a parameter
