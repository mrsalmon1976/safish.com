I listened to a great TED Talk today about effective communication today - [How to Write Less by say More by Jim Vandehei](https://www.ted.com/talks/jim_vandehei_how_to_write_less_but_say_more).

Jim has found, through data, that:

- people spend, on average, only 26 seconds reading anything they choose to read
- people rarely complete and article, often sharing articles on social media they haven't even read
- 70% of employees want shorter communications at work

There are other findings, but my interest was regarding corporate communication, where the message is clear that you need to keep communication short if you want your message to be read/understood.

I advise listening to the podcast, but for my memory, in summary, Jim suggests the following:

1. Consider your audience - what do they need to know?  Don't think about your own agenda, think about <ins>their</ins> agenda.  What do they care about?
2. "Grab me" - ensure the most important message is stated early and clearly - don't waffle, you have limited time before you lose your audience.  Make sure you get their attention as early as possible.
3. Keep it simple - use simple sentence structures and understandable words. 
4. Be human.  Write the way you talk - don't try and look clever.
5. Use as few words and sentences as possible so the message is conveyed - give both the writer and the reader their time back.  You have 26 seconds!
