One of the pieces of software I wrote (10 years ago now!) that I actually use is PhotoTool. This isn't really anything amazing, it 
just works for me when I want to upload photos. I updated it last week to use the [ImageProcessor](http://imageprocessor.org/imageprocessor/) library, and put the horrible source code onto github. The code is pretty bad, but hey, it works for me.
