We have been looking into [columnstore indexes](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/indexes/columnstore-indexes-overview?view=sql-server-ver16) to boost the performance of our data warehouse at [IUA](https://www.iua.co.za). 

While I have found many references that explain that they are and how they work, I've battled to find a nice, summarised explanation of why they are so much faster.  The 
above Microsoft article goes into some detail about this, but I turned to [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) and it gave me the summary I was looking for.

Noted here for my future reference:

> Columnstore indexes are faster than traditional row-based storage indexes for several reasons:
> 
> 1. **Compression:** Columnstore indexes store data in a compressed format, reducing the 
> amount of I/O required to retrieve data.
> 2. **Batch Processing:** Columnstore indexes store data in columns instead of rows. When data is 
> retrieved, it can be processed in bulk, reducing the overhead associated with reading and  
> processing data one row at a time.
> 3. **Vector Processing:** Columnstore indexes take advantage of modern hardware capabilities,
> such as vector processing, to speed up data processing.
> 4. **Data Filtering:** Columnstore indexes can perform data filtering more efficiently than 
> traditional indexes, since they can eliminate large portions of data before reading it.
> 5. **Dedicated Hardware:** Columnstore indexes can be supported by dedicated hardware, such as
> columnar storage systems, which are optimized for columnar data storage and retrieval.
> 
> Overall, these design considerations allow columnstore indexes to be significantly faster than 
> traditional row-based storage indexes for large data sets, especially for analytical queries that 
> involve aggregating large amounts of data.
