Symbolic links in Windows: [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753194(WS.10).aspx](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753194(WS.10).aspx) â€“ this was weird.  I was moaning to Rohland about how I missed have symlinks from Linux, but I'd never bothered to research the alternative in Windows, assuming that Shortcuts were all we have.  It turns out, you CAN make sybmbolic links in Windows.
