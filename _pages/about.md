I'm Matt Salmon, historically a software developer by trade, and currently managing a large technical team.  I have deliberately 
technical as software engineering is what I enjoy.  This site is my personal blog for logging issues that trip me up, so when 
they happen again (they always happen again) I have something to refer to.

I also use it to host some of the software I have written and/or maintain, as well as some calculators I found fun to write and use.
