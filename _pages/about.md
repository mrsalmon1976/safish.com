I'm Matt Salmon, previously a software developer by trade, and currently a manager who dabbles in engineering.  This site is my personal blog for logging issues 
that trip me up, with the idea being that I have a reference for them in future.  Unfortunately, in reality, I find that my "go to" is usually Google and as the 
years go by I often forget I actually recorded a fix, but every once in a while this site helps me so I keep on adding to it.

I also use it to host some of the software I have written and/or maintain, as well as some calculators I found fun to write and use.
