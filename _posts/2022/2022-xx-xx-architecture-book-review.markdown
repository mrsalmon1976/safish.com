Context - In this section of the ADR we will add a short one- or two-sentence description of the problem, and list the alternative solutions.
Decision - In this section we will state the architecture decision and provide a detailed justification of the decision.
Consequences - In this section of the ADR we will describe any consequences after the decision is applied, and also discuss the trade-offs that were considered.
