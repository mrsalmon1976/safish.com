<h1>Agile</h1>

- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=502ILHjX9EE) - great, short video on Agile product ownership
- [https://glenngillen.com/thoughts/quickstart-guide-to-agile](https://glenngillen.com/thoughts/quickstart-guide-to-agile) - excellent opinion article on agile software development

<h1>Multimedia</h1>

- [http://www.favicon.cc/](http://www.favicon.cc/) - create your own icons
- [PNGOUT](http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm) – this is a FREE tool that reduces the size of PNG files by 5 – 30%.  Running this on all images for presentations, blog posts and web sites is a pretty good idea!

<h1>Security</h1>

- [https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/password-guidance-simplifying-your-approach](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/password-guidance-simplifying-your-approach) - don't take my word for it: password guidance from the NCSC

<h1>Utilities for Windows</h1>

- [Teracopy](http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php) – I love this tool.  It also queues copying requests so you don't end up with a hard drive going back and forth like a scratch record.
